###This 'readme' file will contain the writing portion of this project. This includes:
1) Explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
2) At least 5 user stories.

I have chosen to pursue to the concentration project with the following description/bonuses:

### Concentration

Sometimes just called "Memory", it's a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. If you get all the matching cards, you've won!

###Bonus

Let the user choose from different 'decks'
Add timers / scoring based on timers
Think of some fun way to modify the rules of

###Getting Started; bronze-silver-gold paths

Gold: Fully meets wire-frame drawing of site. Achieved back-end functionality for playing memory with different tile sizes. GIF files embedded in tiles for matching. Incorporates all three bonuses proposed in above description. Has bar at the top  which keeps number of turns, reset button, deck options, and a brief message. Flows nicely when adjusting the screen size of the browser.

Silver:Fully meets wire-frame drawing of site. Achieved back-end functionality for playing memory with a few different tile sizes and numbers only.

Bronze: Partially meets wire frame drawing of site. Achieves back-end functionality to make game playable with numbers and prompts (not necessarily clicks)

###User Stories:
1) As a user, I should be able to open the site in the browser and clearly indicate the purpose of the site (memory game) and the method for playing.
2) As a user, I should be have some method to reveals cards/tiles in order to play the game.
3) As a user, I should be able to see all the cards/tiles that I successfully matched after revealing their correct pairs.
4) As a user, I should be able to click on clearly identified cards/tiles to increase the user-friendliness of the game.
5) As a user, I should be able to see how long and how many turns it has taken me to correctly complete the matching game.
